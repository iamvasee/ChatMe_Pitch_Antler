ChatMe Investor Pitch Deck
Slide 1: Title Slide
ChatMe: India's AI Companion Platform "The future of emotional AI, built for 1.4B desi hearts."
Tagline: "Not just chat. Real connection."
Visual: Modern, vibrant design with Indian cultural elements, showing diverse AI character avatars

Slide 2: The Problem
Global AI Fails at Indian Context
74% of Indian internet users prefer content in local languages (IAMAI 2023)
42% of urban Indians report feeling lonely (NCRB Mental Health Survey)
Current AI understands Hinglish, Bollywood references, or regional slang but i think it could be better.
The Gap
Generic chatbots feel robotic and culturally disconnected
No AI platform built specifically for Indian emotional intelligence
Millions crave companionship and relatable AI experiences
India needs an AI platform that feels local, personal, and alive.

Slide 5: Product Showcase
AI Characters That Feel Real
Characters in multiple characters including fictional characters (Baba Instaram, Danknath, Misti Didi, Anita, Rajveer) and real people who lived among us (Sir Ratan Tata, Honorable Ex president of India APJ Abdul Kalam Sir) and indian gods and mythological characters like 
Key Features
Multilingual UI: Fully localized experience in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali and many more.
Memory Layer: Characters remember past chats, inside jokes, user preferences
Emotional Intelligence: Detects mood, adapts tone, provides appropriate responses.
Evolving Personalities: Characters grow based on user interactions. (Whever ai has to comeup with something fictional about their backstory because of the user’s probe, it adds that to the Chatacter’s backstory in JSON format to preserve storage)
User Experience
UI Closely mimics Whatsapp for familiarity with indian users. 
Token Economy: ₹9-9999 packs for purchase of tokens.
Subscription: Currently not available because India is a very low trust economy and it doesnt work very well with subscriptions. We can launch subscriptions based on the user behavious pattern and offer it to power users.
BYOK - I’m considering a feature for users who can bring their own OpenAi api key. Because without using out own OpenAi credits, we can collect user data.
Cross-Platform Sync: Seamless experience across devices.
Gamification - Daily Streaks, (10 free tokens everyday),
Badges - We offer challenge completed badges to users like (Completed one month, Completed 100 conversation, Completed 1000 messages) etc.

Slide 6: Business Model
Three Pillars of Revenue
1. Consumer Revenue
Tokens: Prepaid credits (₹9 to  ₹9999 packs)
Premium chats, voice notes, exclusive content
Character unlocks and special conversations
Subscriptions: VIP plans (₹299–499/month)
Unlimited messages, faster responses
Exclusive characters, early feature access
In-App Ads: Native brand placements
Contextual ads integrated into conversations
Non intrusive ads.
Sponsored character interactions
2. Brand Revenue
Sponsored AI Influencers: Characters as brand ambassadors
Branded Characters: Custom AI personalities for companies
AI Influencer Marketing: 24/7 scalable brand campaigns
How we will do this? We will set up twitter and Instagram account for these AI characters they post regularly like influencers which will drive traffic to the app and also it can act as an influencer and promote other brands.
3. Infrastructure Revenue (The Vision)
Memory-as-a-Service API: User context for third-party AI apps.
AI operated brilliantly with right context.
ChatMe.At is an extension of my original Idea called MemOne. Where users let other app GET and POST personal information about them using oAuth style security. Lets say a interview you take on GoogleMeet, an app or a browser extension observes that conversation and POST that memory to the centralised database and Another app can GET that context from the database and draft a article about it on LinkedIn. Or Make a tweet. Or an LLM that can provide insights into it. Or a social media app which can use it to serve better ads.
But being the infrastructure we need to build two side of things, apps that can store memories and other apps that can use the memory. Now nobody wants to integrate to an dempty database. We use ChatMeAt to collect rich personal data about the user and charge the other apps to use it to serve the user better. With Authentication ofcourse. 
How are we going to get that data? When a user sends a message, we will use a Small a dirt cheap model hosted directly with us too understand the context and if its revealing anything about the user, we will rephrase it in simpler text format and store it with the database for the user.
